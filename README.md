## About Us

Alice and JP met in Brazil in 2005 and after years of staying in touch, we decided to move in together. We got our dog Choco in 2021 and lived together in Lund, Sweden. We hope you can make it to our wedding as we take the next step in our lives together!

## Schedule of Events

## Registry

As we look forward to our future together, we would like to spend more time with each other in a happier environment, with fewer possessions. While we appreciate any gesture of generosity, we kindly request that you consider giving the gift of your presence instead of a physical gift. However, if you feel inclined to give, we would be grateful for a contribution to our honeymoon or a charity that is close to your heart. Above all, we value your presence at our wedding more than anything else.
