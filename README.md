## Save the Date

Join us in beautiful Boipeba, Brazil on October 25-27, 2024 for our wedding celebration!

## About Us

Alice and JP met in Brazil in 2005 and after years of staying in touch, we decided to move in together. We got our dog Choco in 2021 and lived together in Lund, Sweden. We hope you can make it to our wedding as we take the next step in our lives together!

## Travel Information

The best way to get to Boipeba is to fly to Salvador. We'll provide transport from the airport on Friday, October 25th, 2024. If you're travelling from Sweden, you don't need a visa, but check with your embassy if you're travelling from another country. We can provide more details and guide you.

## Accommodation

Stay near the beaches of Velha Boipeba, on the north side. Around the beach [Boca da Barra](https://goo.gl/maps/tJuJ45CgrtzN98vB7) is good.

If you like "pousada" style there's [Pousada Pouso da Mar√©](https://goo.gl/maps/N3p6NQ7C7sP2BiC56) and [Pousada Marina de Boipeba](https://goo.gl/maps/h3ou3yWtppK3FgUU8) that we liked. The second is perfect if you plan to go kayaking or surfing. For an apartment with kitchen there's [Pousada Vila da Barra Boipeba](https://goo.gl/maps/hgGJsdCp73HNeRp56), and if you really want to live it up there's cozy houses at the top of the mountain, with an elevator, at [Pousada Mangabeiras](https://goo.gl/maps/Bh4mY6bEr8FXrpqA9).

## Schedule of Events

We'll have a more detailed schedule of events soon, but the wedding will be on Saturday with fun activities on Friday and Sunday.

## Registry

As we look forward to our future together, we would like to spend more time with each other in a happier environment, with fewer possessions. While we appreciate any gesture of generosity, we kindly request that you consider giving the gift of your presence instead of a physical gift. However, if you feel inclined to give, we would be grateful for a contribution to our honeymoon or a charity that is close to your heart. Above all, we value your presence at our wedding more than anything else.
