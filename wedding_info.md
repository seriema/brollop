## Save the Date

Join us on a beach in São Paulo, Brazil, in late October 2024 for our wedding celebration!

## About Us

Alice and JP met in Brazil in 2005 and after years of staying in touch we decided to live together in Stockholm, Sweden, from 2014. In 2021 we got engaged and our dog Choco. Now we hope you can make it to our wedding as we take the next step in our lives together!

## Travel Information

The best way to get to São Paulo from abroad is by flight to either [Congonhas](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NrsJdrgLUzvwZfDx9) or [Guarulhos](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wKeZf8BBR8zt5kx9A) airport. We'll provide transport to the venue.

If you're a Swedish citizen then you don't need a visa. Other nationalities please check with your embassy. We can provide more details and guide you.

## Accommodation

We will find accomodations near the wedding venue, with overnight stays for two nights (the night before and on the night of the wedding celebration).

But first, we need to know roughly how many are coming! So please let us know here: [https://forms.gle/HqnM64rmcV532sTJ6](https://forms.gle/HqnM64rmcV532sTJ6)

## Schedule of Events

We'll have a more detailed schedule of events soon, but the wedding will most likely be on Saturday with some activities on Friday and Sunday.

## Registry

As we look forward to our future together, we would like to spend more time with each other in a happier environment, with fewer possessions. While we appreciate any gesture of generosity, we kindly request that you consider giving the gift of your presence instead of a physical gift. However, if you feel inclined to give, we would be grateful for a contribution on [this PayPal link](https://paypal.me/jpjohansson) or a charity that is close to your heart. Above all, we value your presence at our wedding more than anything else.
