# About Boipeba

Welcome to Boipeba, a tranquil island paradise that we fell in love with! After spending two years in a city apartment during the pandemic, we needed a change of pace, and Boipeba was the perfect contrast. The island is a protected nature reserve, so cars aren't allowed, which means lots of nature with few and low buildings. It's a bit complicated to get here, but the inhabitants like it that way, which makes the island very, very safe. Bikes aren't even locked, and children play at night.

To get around the island, we highly recommend the public transportation in the form of a tractor pulling a bus-like wagon. Stay away from the quadwheels driven by younger males trying to make a buck off tourists as they'll give you misinformation about the public transport. The bus is about R$ 10, and quads are R$ 40-60. We recommend taking the bus or walking as to not encourage practices that would turn the island into a tourist trap.

Seafood is abundant, and drinks, chocolate, and coconuts are plentiful. If you're looking to exercise, there's a gym called [Boipeba Fitness](https://goo.gl/maps/PPJTtQqsn2MwvTTx8), Capoeira, a traditional Brazilian dance/martial art (JP highly recommends you try it!), and a judo dojo. Plus, there are plenty of surfing and kayaking opportunities around the island.

If you're already in Brazil, you might want to check out other cities too. Salvador is where you'll land to and from the island, and it might be worth a visit. Rio de Janeiro is a classic beach vacation city with lots of tourism, while São Paulo is a big metropolis (think New York instead of beaches). Just north of Boipeba, there's an island called Morro de São Paulo, which is a touristy version of Boipeba.

Come to Boipeba and unwind in this idyllic setting. You won't regret it!
